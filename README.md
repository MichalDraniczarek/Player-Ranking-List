About the Application:
The application generates players with scores in various categories, in the amount specified by the user (player limit: 9999).

It generates a table with players and assigns them specific positions.

The table includes a scrolling option with navigation to the next tab using arrows located at the bottom. It also offers the ability to choose how many players to display in one column (25, 50, 100), and supports sorting through different algorithms selected by the user. Additionally, it measures the time taken for each sorting operation.

There is also an option to save the generated data; however, this functionality still contains bugs both during saving and loading processes.

Learning Objectives:

    To create a larger, more organized application while following the “Clean Code” principle

    To get familiar with and implement basic TypeScript mechanics

    To learn and implement basic sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, and quicksort

    To understand REST and utilize the fetch method, as well as asynchronous operations using async/await, and to become familiar with the concept and behavior of Promise

    The data handled by the application is sent to a virtual JSON server at: http://localhost:3000/

    Numerous smaller functionalities, including dynamic creation and deletion of elements, working with SASS, handling multiple complex objects, implementing sorting algorithms, designing the page layout, further practice with Git, and input validation

Issues:

    Occasional error when changing the number of players displayed in the table

    Error when loading data from the server

    Sporadic bugs when saving data to the server

Summary:

Not all of the program's intended functionalities were achieved. Nevertheless, many milestones were reached during the development of this application, including gaining experience with SASS, TypeScript, asynchronous programming, the fetch method, file transmission to the server, modularizing the program into smaller, reusable functions, navigating and creating more advanced code structures, and many smaller improvements and accomplishments throughout the process.
